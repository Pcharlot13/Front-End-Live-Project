## Live Project!

The live project was essentially a website of hobbies that each student attending that course had to add too. Mine was about Pixel Art. It was a website that had a small home page, a meet the staff section, and a gallery. The website also had a couple of features that made it responsive to moblie devices. It was also made to be easy to navigate through, and it was connected to a page with other student's websites on there too.
One of the features that we'll look at are the modal that was created to get an artist's information, if they wanted to post their Art on the site.
