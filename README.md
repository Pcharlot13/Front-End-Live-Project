# Front-End-Live-Project

This is a project summary of the Front-End Development Live project I attened at the Tech Academy. This live projcet is a two week sprint. During those sprints I gained experience that will be benefical to me as a front-end developer. Here are some of the skills I learned, refined, and practiced during the live project.

### Skills:
- <b>Communication</b>
- <b>Problem Solving</b>
- <b>Logical thinking</b>
- <b>Fundamental Programming (HTML/CSS/JS)</b>
- <b>Source Control</b>
- <b>DevOps</b>
- <b>Development workload organization</b>

## Live Project!

The live project was essentially a website of hobbies that each student attending that course had to add too. Mine was about Pixel Art. It was a website that had a small home page, a meet the staff section, and a gallery. The website also had a couple of features that made it responsive to moblie devices. It was also made to be easy to navigate through, and it was connected to a page with other student's websites on there too.
One of the features that we'll look at are the modal that was created to get an artist's information, if they wanted to post their Art on the site.

#### HTML Code
This modal was made for artist that wanted to have their Art on the website. It was also connected to a formspree api.

#### CSS Code
This is the styling part of the modal, giving it features that would activate based on the JS code. The CSS made it simple and it was also adjusted so that it apears well on mobile devices also.

#### Javascript Code
This is the javascript portion of the modal. I simply used a couple of conditional statements to allow the button to display and hide the modal.

### Summary

Overall, my expirence at the Tech Academy was great. I already had some expirence programming with C#, but I didn't have any real foundational knowledge about computers and programming concepts. The biggest aid that the Tech academy gave me was not just learning HTML,CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. The biggest aid was giving me the foundational knowledge of computers, programming concepts, Devops, an tangible conception of how development works, and many other Dev Tools I can add to my arsenal. The Live project brought all of that togather and allowed me to have some hands on practical expirence.
